# Program.cs FILE in ASP.NET Core MVC

In ASP.NET Core 6.0 (not 8.0, as there isn't a version 8.0 as of my last update), the `Program.cs` file is still a crucial part of the application's setup. It's where the application's host is configured, services are registered, middleware is configured, and the web host is bootstrapped. Here's the structure of a typical `Program.cs` file in an ASP.NET Core 6.0 application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }

        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                {
                    webBuilder.ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
                    {
                        // Configure services
                        services.AddControllersWithViews();
                        // Add other services...
                    })
                    .Configure(app =>
                    {
                        // Configure middleware pipeline
                        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
                        app.UseStaticFiles();
                        app.UseRouting();
                        app.UseAuthentication();
                        app.UseAuthorization();
                        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
                        {
                            endpoints.MapControllers();
                            // Add other endpoints...
                        });
                    });
                });
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of each part:

1. **`Main` method**:
   - This is the entry point of the application.
   - It calls `CreateHostBuilder` method to create an instance of `IHostBuilder`, builds it, and runs the host.

2. **`CreateHostBuilder` method**:
   - This method is responsible for configuring the host builder.
   - It typically starts with `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)` which sets up common configurations for the host, such as loading configuration from appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.

3. **`ConfigureWebHostDefaults`**:
   - This method is specific to configuring the web host.
   - It sets up the web server, Kestrel, and other web-related configurations.
   - Inside this method, you can call `ConfigureServices` to specify the service configuration and `Configure` to specify the middleware configuration.

4. **Service Configuration**:
   - Services are configured inside the `ConfigureServices` method.
   - In the provided example, `services.AddControllersWithViews()` is used to add MVC services. You can add other services required by your application here.

5. **Middleware Configuration**:
   - Middleware configuration is done inside the `Configure` method.
   - Middleware components such as HTTPS redirection, static files, routing, authentication, and authorization are added to the middleware pipeline here.
   - Endpoints are defined using `UseEndpoints`, where you specify how requests should be handled based on routes.

This structure provides a modular way to configure and bootstrap ASP.NET Core applications, allowing you to easily add, remove, or modify functionality as needed.
