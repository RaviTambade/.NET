In the context of web applications, an IOC (Inversion of Control) container is a design pattern used to manage the instantiation and lifetime of objects within an application. The IOC container is responsible for resolving dependencies between classes and providing instances of these classes as needed.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts related to IOC containers in web applications:

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the dependencies of a class are provided from the outside rather than being created within the class itself. This promotes loose coupling between classes and makes the application more modular and easier to maintain.

2. **Inversion of Control (IOC)**:
   Inversion of Control refers to the principle of delegating control over object creation and lifecycle management to an external framework or container. Instead of classes creating instances of their dependencies directly, they rely on the IOC container to provide these dependencies when needed.

3. **IOC Container**:
   An IOC container is a framework or library that implements the IOC pattern. It typically provides mechanisms for registering dependencies and resolving them at runtime. IOC containers often support features such as constructor injection, property injection, and automatic dependency resolution.

4. **Registration**:
   In an IOC container, dependencies are registered with the container along with instructions on how to create them. This registration typically occurs during application startup. Dependencies can be registered by type, interface, or name.

5. **Resolution**:
   When a class requires a dependency, it requests it from the IOC container. The container then resolves the dependency based on the registration information and provides an instance of the requested type.

6. **Lifetime Management**:
   IOC containers often support different lifetime management options for registered dependencies. Common lifetime scopes include singleton (a single instance shared across the application), transient (a new instance created for each request), and scoped (a single instance per request scope).

In a web application, IOC containers are commonly used to manage the dependencies of controllers, services, repositories, and other components. This helps to decouple these components and facilitates easier testing, scalability, and maintenance of the application. Popular IOC containers for .NET web applications include Autofac, Ninject, StructureMap, and Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (built-in with ASP.NET Core).
