# 60-day .NET FullStack Application Development Plan:

<b>Deliverables</b>: Soft copy Notes, Case Study Implementation, solved examples, Lot of Live Interactions throughout the Learning Process. 

<b>Prerequisite</b>: Having Programming experience in any programming language like Java, JavaScript, Python would be added advantage but not necessary. 

<b>Objective</b>: This hands-on learning in team and passionate mentor would reduce participants learning curve for Dot Net Core Full Stack Skill Development. At the end of Learning process participants would be able to work on Dot Net core applications. Participants would be able to build , test, deploy & Integrate Full Stack application into AWS Cloud, Azure Cloud using Containerized Platform. 

## Case study Driven Training Approach 

Build more than one full Stack applications, Manage Development , build, and deployment processing using Continuous Development, Continuous Integration using DevOps tool such as GitHub, Jenkins, Visual Code, AWS/ Azure Cloud. Learn concepts using case study. 
Learn by Doing.
